            <h1>Harrison Varnadoe</h1>
            <p>Currently I am computer science student at Kennesaw State University, graduating May 2025. Most recently I participated in an internship with NCR Voyix contributing to web development and API integration with Elasticsearch. I have a broad foundation in Java, C#, and Angular. Combining my technical proficiency with leadership skills gained as an Eagle Scout and a team leader at Glisson Camp and Retreat Ministries gives me a unique perspective on working in collaborative settings. Additionally, I've had hands-on experience in computer and cellphone repair, showcasing my problem-solving abilities and adaptability.</p>
